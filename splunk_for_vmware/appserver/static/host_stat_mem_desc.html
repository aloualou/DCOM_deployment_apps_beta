Shown below are the memory related performance details of the selected Hosts/VM’s. These statistics are useful for a variety of purposes. For instance, by inspecting all hosts within a particular vCenter or Cluster one can identify any host that is utilizing more memory compared to others and then inspect the VM’s on that host to identify any that could be moved to a less utilized host. Note that hosts and clusters without VM's are excluded from this view.
