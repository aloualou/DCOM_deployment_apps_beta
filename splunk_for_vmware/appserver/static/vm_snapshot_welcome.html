<p class="p1"><b>Total Space-</b> In addition to the vmsn files a snapshot may contain other files like vmsd(stores the metadata or structure of the snapshot tree), vmdk(descriptor files) and -delta.vmdk(file that contains the changes done on this snapshot in relation with its parents). Total Space gives the space used by vmsn files along with these other files.</p>
