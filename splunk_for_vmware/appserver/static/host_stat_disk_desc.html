Shown below are the storage related performance details of the selected Hosts/VMâ€™s. This comprises the sub-perftypes of disk, dStore, and sAdapt. These statistics are useful for a variety of purposes. For instance, by inspecting all hosts one can identify any host that is exhibiting unusually high latency or low read/write speeds, then drill down to the VM level and identify which VM could be causing the issue. From there, running searches against datastore information qualified and filtered by the offending VM could further illuminate the problem. Note that hosts and clusters without VM's are excluded from this view.
