Shown below are the network related performance details of the selected Hosts/VM’s. These statistics are useful for a variety of purposes. For instance, by inspecting all VM’s one could identify the high traffic users of the network and ensure they are distributed appropriately across the available resources. If not, the chart of hosts would help by easily identifying the hosts producing relatively small quantities of network traffic. Note that hosts and clusters without VM's are excluded from this view.
