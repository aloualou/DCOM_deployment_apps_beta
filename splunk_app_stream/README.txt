The Splunk App for Stream install package includes:

* Splunk_TA_stream: Provides passive capture of event data from live network traffic, and sends that data to Splunk indexers via modular input.

* splunk_app_stream: Provides configuration management for the Splunk_TA_stream. You can use the splunk_app_stream to configure the TA to capture a variety of network event types for multiple network protocols.

You can also use the app to perform data aggregation, as well as additional filtering and translation, prior to indexing. And the app provides a variety of default dashboards that let you view important Network Interface and Processor metrics.
