Release Notes - Google Maps for Splunk
======================================

Version 1.1: May 2011

Internal changes
================

The module now uses the _geo field instead of the _lat and _lng fields to resolve the location.
The geoip and the geonormalize command are now emitting this field. It contains the combined
latitude/longitude information in the form "<lat>,<lng>" (eg. "47.11,0.815").

Geolocation Lookup
==================

The geolocation lookup now uses the Maxmind GeoLite City database. The geoip command is now
emitting different fields:

<field>_latitude, <field>_longitude,
<field>_country_name, <field>_country_code, <field>_region_name, <field>_city, and the _geo field

There are various options that can be configured in the geoip.conf. An app setup sceenis provided
as well.

Instead of using the geoip command, it's now possible to leverage the geo lookup:
Examples:

... | lookup geo ip as clientip
... | lookup geo ip as src_ip
... | lookup geo ip OUTPUT _geo

The lookup definition is disabled by default.

UI Changes
==========

* Module changes
** More configuration options for the module
** Scrollwheel zooming is turned off by default
** Streetview is turned off
** Introduced opacity for cluster icons (Only in Browsers supporting native opacity).
** Added new mapStyles (See dark view).
** The module now persist settings like center, zoom and map style.

* The default view (maps) has changed:
** Removed fields side-panel
** Added 2 panel to kind-of debug the results (Geo Results and Events)

Drilldown
=========

The module supports drilldown since 1.1 in 2 flavors:

1. Custom field drilldown

When using the module in a custom dashboard, you can specify a drilldown field. All unique field
values are then collected per location. When a marker or [[Cluster]] is clicked, those values are
automatically combined/formatted in the form of

    ((<drilldown_field>=<value1>) OR (<drilldown_fields>=<value2) OR ...)

This partitial search string will be propagated to downstream modules as a setting (maps.drilldown)
an can be leveraged using eg. a stringreplace intention. See the drilldown_demo views.

2. Automatic drilldown

When there is no drilldown_field specified the drilldown can only happen when a marker is clicked
that represents a single location (ie. not when a cluster is clicked). So when a marker with 2 or
more locations (distinct _geo values) is clicked, the maps view will be centered on the cluster
location and the zoom level will be incremented. In the case of a single location the module will
propagate the setting maps.click containing the _geo value. This setting can be used in all kinds
of intentions (stringreplace, addterm, etc) or using the GeoDrilldown Module which will
essentially append  | search _geo=<value> to the search string.
