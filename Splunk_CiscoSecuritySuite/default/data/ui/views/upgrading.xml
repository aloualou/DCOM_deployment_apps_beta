<h2>Upgrading from Prior Versions of the Cisco Security Suite</h2>

<p>Welcome to the new version of the Cisco Security Suite.  As part of this upgrade, we have completely
re-designed the app from the ground up to incorporate the latest thinking in Common Information Model,
Technology Add-ons and Data Models.</p>

<p>Before Continuing:</p>

<ul>
<li>You must remove all prior versions of the Splunk Cisco Security Suite, including Splunk_CiscoFirewalls, Splunk_CiscoIronportWSA, Splunk_CiscoIronportESA and Splunk_CiscoIPS before installing this app.</li>
<li>Update the Technology Add-ons, per the <a href="getting_started">Getting Started</a> instructions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The standard source types have changed for most of the Cisco inputs to conform to the standard
naming scheme.  For example, cisco_asa has become cisco:asa.  You can either alter the Technology Add-on
to use the old name, or you can alter the Supporting Add-on eventtypes to search for both types.
</p>

<p>
For Web Security, we have added additional fields to the standard logging configuration so that
more data is collected and reported on, making bandwidth reports and browser reports possible.  As a
result, you should not use older data for Web Security reporting.
</p>

you note that you are using the Cisco Security Suite v3 on Splunk Enterprise 6.</p>
