<h1>Welcome to the Cisco Security Suite for Splunk</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This application for Splunk Enterprise 6 covers Cisco Firewalls, the Web Security Appliance, and Cisco Identity Services.  Firewalls
include the Cisco ASA 5500 series, FWSM 3.x and 4.x, and Cisco PIX 5.0 and higher.  This is a complete re-write 
of the Cisco Security Suite to take advantage of the Common Information Model (CIM) and designed to be compatible
with the data models in the <a href="http://apps.splunk.com/app/1621/" target="_blank">CIM app</a> and <a href="http://apps.splunk.com/app/263/" target="_blank">Enterprise Security 3.x</a>.
</p>

<h2>Upgrading from versions prior to 3.0.x</h2>
<p>
If you are upgrading from a version prior to 3.0.x, you will need to understand exactly what changes have been made to the underlying data
so that you can decide how to deal with the old data.  Please refer to the <a href="upgrading">Upgrading</a> page
for more information.
</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>
With any Splunk app, there are 2 parts:
<ol>
<li>Data collection</li>
<li>Data visualization/analytics</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Data Collection</h3>
<p>
The Cisco Security Suite for Splunk is not configured for any data collection by default.

Extra apps known as technology add-ons (TA) must be downloaded to collect data for the various Cisco products.  TAs are responsible for collecting data and usually do not have any visualizations.  The Cisco Security Suite for Splunk
does not contain any TAs itself.  These TAs must be downloaded and installed separately for each product type you want to use in the Cisco Security Suite for Splunk.  Links to the specific TAs
needed for the Cisco Security Suite for Splunk are listed in the steps below detailing setups.
</p>

<p> </p>

<h3>Data Visualizations</h3>
<p>
Data visuzalizations including dashboards and forms are conatined in a supporting add-on (SA).  By default, no SAs are enabled for the Cisco Security Suite for Splunk.  Unlike TAs, SAs are contained within the Cisco Security Suite for Splunk.
These SAs are located in <code>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_CiscoSecuritySuite/appserver/addons/</code>.  In order to enable an SA, the SA folder for the specific product(s) you want to use must be copied to
<code>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/</code>.  Please note that the Splunk server must be restarted after the SAs are copied to the correct place.  More details follow in the documentation below about TAs and SAs.
</p>

<p>
This TA/SA separation is by design so that only the data that applies to your environment is collected and presented.
This also allows for greater extensibility by using Splunk 6 Pivot features and the Common Information Model framework.
</p>

<h2>Setting up Cisco ASA</h2>

<h3>Setup Data Visualization (SA)</h3>

<ol>
	<li>
		Copy the <code>SA-cisco-asa</code> directory from:
		<ul>
			<li>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_CiscoSecuritySuite/appserver/addons/SA-cisco-asa</li>
		</ul>
		To:
		<ul>
			<li>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/SA-cisco-asa</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	
	<li>Restart Splunk</li>
</ol>

<h3>Setup Data collection (TA)</h3>

<ol>
	<li><a href="http://apps.splunk.com/app/1620/" target="_blank">Download the Add-on for Cisco ASA</a>.  The add-on needs to be installed to the search head to allow a user to use the search-time knowledge provided within the add-on.</li>
	<li>From the Splunk web interface, click on App -> Manage Apps to open the Apps Management page in <a href="/manager/launcher/apps/local" target="_blank">Manager</a>.</li>
	<li>Click the "Install app from file" button, locate the downloaded file and click "Upload".</li>
	<li>Verify (if necessary) that the app is installed.  It should be listed in the list of apps installed within the <a href="/manager/launcher/apps/local" target="_blank">Manager</a> and can be found on the server at $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_cisco-asa</li>
	<li>
		For more detailed information about the Cisco ASA data collection, refer to the <a href="/app/Splunk_CiscoSecuritySuite/asa_documentation">Cisco ASA configuration detailed documentation</a>
		(requires that the above SA-cisco-asa be in the correct place) or the README file that is part of the Add-on for Cisco ASA.
	</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>
<h3>Splunk Add-On for Cisco ASA Configuration Tip</h3>
Forcing the sourcetype for received Cisco data, where you have multiple types of cisco data flowing to the Splunk Indexer on a single port.

<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <code>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_cisco-asa directory</code>.</li>
<li>Create a new directory named <code>local</code>.</li>
<li>Navigate into the <code>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_cisco-asa/default</code> directory.</li>
<li>Copy the <code>props.conf</code> configuration file and place it into the previously created <code>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_cisco-asa/local</code> directory.</li>
<li>Navigate into the <code>$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/Splunk_TA_cisco-asa/local</code> directory.</li>
<li>Open the <code>props.conf</code> configuration file.</li>
<li>Remove the # (commented out markers) at the beginning of the below text in the props.conf file.
	<ul>
	<li>Note: If you have the data going to a different port or protocol then make the appropriate adjustments, such as if you have cisco asa data being received on tcp port 515, then replace source::udp:514 with source::tcp:515.</li>
	<li>#[source::udp:514]</li>
	<li>#TRANSFORMS-force_sourcetype_for_cisco = force_sourcetype_for_cisco_asa,force_sourcetype_for_cisco_pix,force_sourcetype_for_cisco_fwsm</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Save the props.conf configuration file.</li>
<li>Restart the Splunk Service/Daemon.</li>

<h2>Setting up Cisco ISE</h2>
<p>
	The Cisco ISE integration is slightly different than ASA, ESA, or WSA.  There is a stand-alone Cisco ISE app that includes data collection and visualizations.  This app must be installed for the Cisco Security Suite to include ISE data.
	If you prefer to hide the stand-alone ISE app, this can be accomplished by launching <a href="/manager/launcher/apps/local" target="_blank">Splunk Manager</a> and editing the properties of the Cisco ISE app.
</p>

<h3>Setup Data collection (TA)</h3>
