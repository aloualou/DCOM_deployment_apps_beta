++ Application Details

Sourcetype(s):            cisco:ios, Cisco:SmartCallHome  
Supported Technologies: Cisco IOS, IOS-XE, NX-OS, IOS XR, WLC devices


++ Installation Instructions

The Cisco Networks Add-on can be downloaded, installed, and configured to receive Cisco IOS and WLC data by either using the Splunk app setup screen or by manually installing and configuring the app.
This app does not add any new inputs, it merely rewrites syslog events matching the IOS format. You need to already have IOS events coming in as the syslog OR cisco:ios sourcetype.

+++ Setup and configuration

1. Install in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/TA-cisco_ios

2. Make sure your Cisco devices by default log to one of the following sourcetypes: cisco:ios OR syslog (A regex match will be performed to rewrite the events to the cisco:ios sourcetype)

3. (OPTIONAL for Smart Call Home support)

3.1. OPTIONAL - Add a new TCP data input on a port of your choice, set sourcetype to Cisco:SmartCallHome

3.2. OPTIONAL - On your Cisco devices:
--  
service call-home  
call-home  
 contact-email-addr YOUR.EMAIL@ADDR.ESS  
 site-id "YOUR_SITE_NAME"  
 profile "Splunk"  
  destination transport-method http  
  destination address http http://SPLUNK.SERVER.IP:TCP_PORT_FROM_3.1  
  subscribe-to-alert-group diagnostic severity debug  
  subscribe-to-alert-group environment severity debug  
  subscribe-to-alert-group inventory  
  subscribe-to-alert-group inventory periodic daily 22:30  
--

4. Restart Splunk


++ TODO
* In transforms.conf: NEED TO ADD extract_cisco_ios-general-wlc (8500) and remove the # extraction above. Because time ends up in reported_hostname
