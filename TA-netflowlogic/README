   ===Using this Technology Add-on===

   Configuration: Automatic

   Ports for automatic configuration: udp:10514

   In case the also “NetFlow for Splunk App” is installed, the netflow data is routed by default to index=flowintegrator.
   The admin role must be configured to look also at the index where netflow data is stored.
   This can be achieved by changing the admin role with adding the additional index to the list of “Indexes searched by default”.

   Warning : When adding indexes to the default search indexes do not include any summary indexes, as this can cause a search and summary index loop.
